<h3 class="interior-header">Seriously, another conference?</h3>

<p>
  Developer Day was born out of the realization that there's a huge amount of development talent and experience 
  spread across the country, and there's absolutely no need to spend a lot of money to get together and learn 
  from each other. Furthermore, so many of the venues for assembling geeks are focused on a single technology. 
  We need less specialization right now, and more places to talk to people for whom tools are tools, but tech 
  is king. When you want to talk to Ruby geeks, head out to RubyFringe or Ruby Hoedown. When Java is on top, 
  catch an NFJS, or JavaOne. But where are you to go when you just want to talk to and hear from people who are
  putting a bunch of technologies to use solving interesting problems? </p>

<h3 class="interior-header">Developer Day is:</h3>
<ul class="bulleted">
  <li>one day only</li>
  <li>very cheap</li>
  <li>incredibly useful</li>
  <li>platform agnostic</li>
  <li>technology-centric</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The first Developer Day was planned by <a href="http://www.viget.com" target="_blank">Viget Labs</a> and 
  <a href="http://thinkrelevance.com/" target="_blank">Relevance</a>, and took place in 
  <a href="/events/2009-durham.html">Durham, NC in March 2009</a>. It was a great success, and served as 
  proof that the high-quality, low-cost <strong>local</strong> conference really worked. We are expanding 
  out to bring the Developer Day experience to cities around the country (and maybe the world). If you are 
  interested in the show coming to your town, come visit us at 
  <a href="http://eventful.com/performers/developer-day-/P0-001-000209697-6/demand" target='_blank'>eventful</a> 
  and make some demands.
