<h2>About Developer Day</h2>

<p>
  Developer Day was born out of the realization that there's a huge amount of development talent and 
  experience spread across the country, and there's absolutely no need to spend a lot of money to 
  get together and learn from each other. 
</p>

<p>
  The first Developer Day was planned by <a href="http://www.viget.com/">Viget Labs</a> and 
  <a href="http://www.thinkrelevance.com/">Relevance</a>, and took place in 
  <a href="/events/2009-durham.html">Durham, NC in March 2009</a>. It was a great success, and 
  served as proof that the high-quality, low-cost <strong>local</strong> conference really worked, 
  so the Developer Day series was born.
