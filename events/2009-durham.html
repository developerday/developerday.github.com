<h1 id="title">March 21st 2009 - Developer Day Durham</h1>

<p>Staying current with the ever-evolving technological possibilities can be challenging, but you love trying. Why? Because you’re a fantastic web developer who loves building things, (and, frankly, that’s just how you roll).</p>
<p>Which is why this conference is perfect for you. </p>
<p>Hear seven presentations given by active practitioners on topics ranging from JavaScript and Scala to Rails performance and security. Each is tailored to give you insight into various topics that may positively influence how you work, regardless of your specialization.</p>
<p>So, come meet cool people, eat some lunch (from local Durham restaurants), and give yourself the day to learn and participate in several great discussions — all for the low, low price of $50.</p>
<p>Registration is closed for March 21st — but keep your eyes peeled for Developer Days in other cities! </p>

    <td><h3 class="talk-title">Evolving Your Git Workflow</h3>
      <p>Git has attracted many developers away from various centralized source control tools, but it’s easy to find yourself using Git like a slightly-better variant of your old VCS. “You don’t even have to be online to commit. Cool!” That’s a nice touch, but Git has way more to offer, and by picking up a few intermediate and advanced Git techniques, you can save a ton of time (and sanity) for yourself and your team. </p>

      <h3 class="talk-title">Optimizing Perceived Performance</h3>
      <p>As Phil Karlton said, “there are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.” Despite enormous advances in the field of web development over the last five years, it remains difficult to use caching to allow sites to scale for expanding user bases. Fortunately, the last few years have also seen the rise of JavaScript libraries that take a lot of the pain out of client-side programming. In this talk, we’ll explore techniques for making your sites feel faster, without resorting to complicated caching schemes, while maintaining strict separation of content, style, and behavior. </p>

      <p>Take a song. Cut it into pieces. Stretch it. Shift the pitch. Stack it on top of other tracks. And you have a new song. We’ll show some simple algorithms for creating new songs that lets Ruby do the heavy lifting. And let Bono do the singing. </p>

      <h3 class="talk-title">Scala: A Modern Programming Language</h3>
      <p>Scala is a language for the Java Virtual Machine that combines the power of Java with the flexibility of a dynamic language and the capabilities of a functional language. We’ll explore how Scala can make standard object-oriented programming more concise and powerful, and how it can make concurrency easy and clear. We’ll specifically show how these capabilities can be used with languages you might already be using, Java and Ruby.</p>

      <h3 class="talk-title">Page Caching Resurrected: A Fairy Tale</h3>
      <p>We’ve seen a number of dramatic changes in Rails over the past year, with the most surprising probably being the announcement of the Rails-Merb merger. No less important, however, is the addition of Rack support, which can have a revolutionary effect on the way we build applications today, much less how we do it when Rails 3 is released. In this session, we’ll explore how Rails on Rack revitalizes page caching as a performance strategy. </p>
