<div id="info">
  <h2>Connect. Learn. Share.</h2>
  
  <p>
    Staying current with the ever-evolving technological possibilities can be challenging, but you love trying. Why? Because you’re a fantastic web developer who loves building things, (and, frankly, that’s just how you roll).
  </p>

  <p>
    Which is why this conference is perfect for you.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hear seven presentations given by active practitioners on topics ranging from JavaScript and Scala to Rails performance and security. Each is tailored to give you insight into various topics that may positively influence how you work, regardless of your specialization.
  </p>

  <p>
    So, come meet cool people, eat some lunch (from local Durham restaurants), and give yourself the day to learn and participate in several great discussions — all for the low, low price of $50.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Registration is <strong>closed</strong> for March 21st — but keep your eyes peeled for Developer Days in other cities!

      his blog is kicking off a new wave of security consciousness throughout the Ruby community and creating an 
      avalanche of better development practices. His passion for exploring new technologies and traveling new 
      roads has quickly shot him up through the Ruby industry and on to the <a href="http://thinkrelevance.com/">Relevance</a> team.

      Jess fled from the ivory tower with a fascination for writing code that automatically generates 
      goodness for video games—from graphics to maps to music. His fascination with rapid prototyping 
      led him to build applications for the web where he contributed to several startups. You can now 
      find him fretting over the front-end of many a web application. Chad has spent the last 10 years 
      roaming the earth building web applications for companies large and small. During his journeys 
      he has contributed regularly to open source in .NET and Ruby. He was last seen championing the

    <h3>You!</h3>
    <p>
      There's a lot of great work being done locally, and we always love to hear about it — so we're adding
      a slot for lightning talks to the agenda. Come prepared to chat about what you're working on or are
      interested in!

          <p>
            Software development happens in your head; not in an editor, IDE, or design tool. We’re 
            well educated on how to work with software and hardware, but what about wetware—our own brains?

          <h3>Evolving Your Git Workflow </h3>

          <p>
            Git has attracted many developers away from various centralized 
            source control tools, but it’s easy to find yourself using Git like a slightly-better 
            variant of your old VCS. “You don’t even have to be online to commit. Cool!” That’s a 
            nice touch, but Git has way more to offer, and by picking up a few intermediate and 
            advanced Git techniques, you can save a ton of time (and sanity) for yourself and your 
            team.

          <h3>Optimizing Perceived Performance </h3>
          <p>
            As Phil Karlton said, “there are only two hard things in Computer 
            Science: cache invalidation and naming things.” Despite enormous advances in the field of 
            web development over the last five years, it remains difficult to use caching to allow 
            sites to scale for expanding user bases. Fortunately, the last few years have also seen the 
            rise of JavaScript libraries that take a lot of the pain out of client-side programming. 
            In this talk, we’ll explore techniques for making your sites feel faster, without resorting 
            to complicated caching schemes, while maintaining strict separation of content, style, and 
            behavior.

          <h3>Getting Girls With Musical Magic and Ruby </h3>

          <p>
            Take a song. Cut it into pieces. Stretch it. Shift the pitch. Stack it 
            on top of other tracks. And you have a new song. We’ll show some simple algorithms for creating 
            new songs that lets Ruby do the heavy lifting. And let Bono do the singing.

          <p>
            With Ruby 1.9 on everyone’s mind, Aaron will walk you through the real-life example 
            of updating RCov to work with the new platform.

          <h3>Scala: A Modern Programming Language </h3>
          <p>
            Scala is a language for the Java Virtual Machine that combines the power of 
            Java with the flexibility of a dynamic language and the capabilities of a functional language. We’ll 
            explore how Scala can make standard object-oriented programming more concise and powerful, and how it 
            can make concurrency easy and clear. We’ll specifically show how these capabilities can be used with 
            languages you might already be using, Java and Ruby.

          <h3>Page Caching Resurrected: A Fairy Tale</h3>
          <p>
            We’ve seen a number of dramatic changes in Rails over the past year, 
            with the most surprising probably being the announcement of the Rails-Merb merger. No less 
            important, however, is the addition of Rack support, which can have a revolutionary effect on 
            the way we build applications today, much less how we do it when Rails 3 is released. In this 
            session, we’ll explore how Rails on Rack revitalizes page caching as a performance strategy.
