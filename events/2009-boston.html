  <h2>Connect. Learn. Share.</h2>
  <p>
    Staying current with the ever-evolving technological possibilities can be challenging, but you love 
    trying. Why? Because you're a fantastic web developer who loves building things, (and, frankly, 
    that's just how you roll).
  </p>

  <p>
    Which is why this conference is perfect for you.
  </p>

  <p>
    We're lining up eight great talks on topics from JavaScript to git, and from document databases to general development 
    practices. No matter what your standard tools, languages, and frameworks, you're guaranteed to learn something new. 
    So, come meet cool people, eat some lunch, and give yourself the day to learn and participate in great discussions — 
    all for the low, low price of $50. <a href="http://viget.eventwax.com/developer-day-boston/register">Register today!</a>

        <h3>Triadic Programming</h3>
        <p>Since the Cold War, the secretive Dyadic Society has been stealthily sapping the strength of the software development community. Haven't heard of them? That just proves that they exist! To conceal the truth from programmers, the Dyads promote their ideology through proxies, using content-free blanket terms such as “best practices” and “design patterns.”</p>
        <p>You can fight the Dyads by avoiding so-called “best practices” such as:</p>
        
        <ul class="bulleted">
          <li>polymorphism via classes and methods</li>
          <li>error handling via throwing and catching exceptions</li>
          <li>thread-safe code via objects and locks</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          Notice the dyads: throw and catch, class and method, object and lock. In this keynote, you will see what the Dyads fear most: a set of Triadic techniques that break the Dyadic chokehold on developers everywhere:
        </p>

        <ul class="bulleted">
          <li>polymorphism via structures, functions, and multiple dispatch</li>
          <li>error handling via signals, handlers, and restarts</li>
          <li>thread-safety via immutable data, references, and transactions</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Remember: threedom is freedom.</p>

        <h3>"Comics" Is Hard: Alternative Databases</h3>
        <p>It sometimes seems like all domains easily map onto relational database like MySQL and Postgres — that we live in a happy land where all Employees are People, and all People are Mammals. Unfortunately, however, there are many domains that just don't map so easily onto a standard relational schema. In this session, we'll look at three general alternatives to the familiar model, as illustrated by some specific examples. We'll also see how some alternative databases provide a better fit for specific domains.</p>

        <h3>An Introduction to CSS 2.1 &amp; CSS 3</h3>
        <p>CSS 2.1 and CSS 3, while not widely supported at the moment, are inching closer and closer to gaining the browser-level support we all wish for. Now that Firefox 3.5 has been released, and because of the fairly high adoption/upgrade rate of it's user-base, front-end developers are one step closer to the stress-reducing benefits these two versions of CSS provide.</p>

        <p>In this presentation, you'll be introduced to a fair chunk of CSS 2.1 and CSS 3 selectors, properties, and values. You'll see actual code, the rendered output of that code, a few in-browser demonstrations, and we'll discuss the ways in which these new items can make your life, as a front-end developer, much easier.</p>

        <p>If you and/or your company supports gracefully degrading certain aspects of a website's design, then you'll be able to apply a large portion of the CSS we'll be discussing right away.</p>

        <h3>Enjoy Your Version Control</h3>
        <p>
          For most developers, dealing with their source control can be
          one of the worst parts of the day. You shouldn't have to fear
          doing merges, making drastic changes without affecting the
          mainline, setting new team members up, or even just pulling down
          the latest changes. You'll learn why Git, a fast and distributed
          version control system, has gained popularity in both open
          source projects and the workplace, and you'll see how it's made
          version control enjoyable once again.

        <p>
          This talk will be a comprehensive look at what you need to know
          to properly test your JavaScript code. Numerous testing
          frameworks will be discussed and examined together with an
          encompassing analysis of the general families of testing
          techniques. If you haven't tested your JavaScript code before -
          or if you're looking for a better way to test your existing code
          - this is the talk for you.
