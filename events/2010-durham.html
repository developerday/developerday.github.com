      <h3 class="talk-title">Having Fun with the Play Framework</h3>
      <p>
        Play! is an exciting web application framework I found this year. It's speedy; it's easy to debug; it's got simple templating; it's solidly RESTful; it's got caching baked-in; and there's no waiting around for files to compile. The surprising part: it's built in and for Java. We're going to see how to rapidly create web apps that perform well and are plain fun to make, and you'll leave with a new-found appreciation for how simple Java can be.
