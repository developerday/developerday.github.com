      <h3 class="talk-title">The Journey To Rspec 2.0, a tale of reinventing the wheel</h3>
      <p>
        Everyone has reinvented the wheel at one point or another.   I'm here
        to tell you there is nothing wrong with that.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this talk you will see how reinventing the wheel played into the
        development of Rspec 2.0.  I will also cover many of the problem areas
        of Rspec 1.0 that prompted a re-write, and some of the exciting new
        features of Rspec 2.0.

      <h3 class="talk-title">Having Fun with the Play Framework</h3>
      <p>
        Play! is an exciting web application framework I found this year. It's speedy; it's easy to debug; it's got simple templating; it's solidly RESTful; it's got caching baked-in; and there's no waiting around for files to compile. The surprising part: it's built in and for Java. We're going to see how to rapidly create web apps that perform well and are plain fun to make, and you'll leave with a new-found appreciation for how simple Java can be.

        <h3 class="talk-title">Round PEG, Round Hole - Parsing Functionally</h3>
        <p>
          Many developers will be familiar with lex, flex, yacc, bison, ANTLR, and other related tools to generate parsers for use inside their own code.  For recognizing computer-friendly languages, however, context-free grammars and their parser-generators leave a few things to be desired. This is about how the seemingly simple prospect of parsing some text turned into a new parser toolkit for Erlang, and why functional programming makes parsing fun and awesome.

      <p>
        I’ve been using, teaching, and evangelizing about jQuery for years. The library's simplicity is seductive; after a while, it kind of writes itself. So why did I venture into the unknown world of Dojo for a recent project? Find out what I learned about JavaScript code organization, inheritance, dependency management, and more in a whirlwind beginner's tour of a toolkit that answers some of the big questions surrounding JavaScript development.

      <h3 class="talk-title">The State of NoSQL</h3>
      <p>
        Over the past year, NoSQL has been one of the most active movements in technology. We've seen the emergence of dozens of new options for persisting data, and the re-emergence of choices that had been used in specific niches. In addition, many of the tensions that characterized the movement initially have been resolved (or at least minimized), leaving open a new way forward.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this session, we'll examine the current state of the NoSQL options, including the four major families (key-value stores, document- and column-oriented databases, and graph databases). We'll see examples of how to use representatives of each family in Ruby, and when you might be better off moving to one of them from a relational database. Finally, we'll explore the possibilities of hybrid systems.
