      <h3 class="talk-title">The Passionate Programmer</h3>
      <p>What should the career path of a programmer be? How do you know what you're aiming for? What defines success?</p>

      <p>Many of us started out assuming the answers to these questions included slowly climbing a corporate promotion structure, ultimately becoming a people or project manager and no longer a programmer.</p>

      <p>But we didn't get into software development so we could fill out spreadsheets and attend status meetings. We got into software development because we were excited about it. We wanted to be creative and to build great things.</p>

      <p>From the author of The Passionate Programmer, this session will walk through how a software developer can not only succeed but work toward building a remarkable career. We'll draw examples from business, the arts, music, and sports. By the end of the presentation, we will have laid out a structured framework for radically succeeding in the software industry.</p>

      <h3 class="talk-title">The Cloud - Real World Applications and Pragmatics</h3>
      <p>
        There is a lot of buzz and hype about building apps in the cloud, but
        not a lot of practical, real world advice or techniques.  This talk
        will cut through the crap and demonstrate an approach to building
        cloud based apps learned through experience in building apps at
        Relevance and RunCodeRun.  We'll use messaging and services to keep
        small pieces loosely joined, cook up configuration management to allow
        you to actually 'auto scale', and discuss practices to keep your app
        stable and happy in production.  Leave your paradigm-shifting
        markitecture synergies at the door.  No ESB-based SOA orchestration
        allowed.  We're gettin' down to business.
      </p>

      <h3 class="talk-title">Playing Nicely with Others</h3>
      <p>
        In the course of writing applications you need more than just a single
        programming language to get the job done.  In most cases there will be more
        than one language involved in the application.
      </p>

      <p>
        This talk will cover cross-language tools that ever developer should consider
        to help solve the problems they face.  I will cover several non-traditional
        queueing, hashing and data storage servers and libraries that will be an
        asset to any developer.
      </p>

      <p>
        The common factor in all these tools, is an interface that is programming
        language independent, or an interface exists for multiple programming
        languages.

      <h3 class="talk-title">Email Interfaces for Your Ruby Apps</h3>
      <p>Email-based user interfaces are an easy and powerful (but often overlooked) way to add a lot of value to web applications. In this presentation, we’ll discuss the advantages of providing an email interface to your app, take a look at some real-world examples (like Posterous, TripIt, and I Want Sandy), and then provide several specific techniques for adding this functionality.</p>

      <h3 class="talk-title">Stepping Up: A Brief Intro to Scala</h3>
      <p>
        The Scala programming language has been gaining momentum recently as an
        alternative (and some might say successor) to Java on the JVM. This talk
        will start with an introduction to basic Scala syntax and concepts, then
        delve into some of Scala's more interesting and unique features. At the
        end we'll show a brief example of how Scala is used by the Lift web
        framework to simplify dynamic web apps.
