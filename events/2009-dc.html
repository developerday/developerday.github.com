  <h2>Connect. Learn. Share.</h2>
  <p>
    Staying current with the ever-evolving technological possibilities can be challenging, but you love 
    trying. Why? Because you’re a fantastic web developer who loves building things, (and, frankly, 
    that’s just how you roll).
  </p>

  <p>
    Which is why this conference is perfect for you.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hear seven presentations given by active practitioners on topics ranging from Ruby 1.9 to browser-based programming, 
    and advanced acceptance testing to front-end development. Each is tailored to give you insight into various topics that may 
    positively influence how you work, regardless of your specialization.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So, come meet cool people, eat some lunch, and give yourself the day to learn and participate in several great 
    discussions — all for the low, low price of $50.

        <h3>Make Everyone a Tester: Natural Language Acceptance Testing</h3> 
        <p>
          Application testing has traditionally been the responsibility of those in formal QA roles or, more 
          recently, the application developers themselves.  Is being a programmer or tester really a requirement 
          for effectively testing your web application?  Discover ways to enable your existing team to write 
          human-readable tests they can run in their own browser.

        <h3>Beyond Thunderdome: Browser-Based Visual Programming with Lily and the Monome</h3> 
        <p>
          Ever wanted to mashup some APIs with an interactive sound generator and control it all with an external 
          physical interface?  Ever wanted to do it all without writing a single line of code?  We'll pit the NY 
          Times DOM against Lily, a browser baser visual programming environment, and the Monome, an external 
          physical computing interface, for the ultimate audio-visual Thunderdome.

        <h4>Justin Marney</h4>
        <p class="bio">
          An engineer by birth, Justin Marney is no stranger to technology. Repeatedly caught dismantling toys as 
          soon he could pick up a screwdriver, his parents were financially driven to provide an outlet for his 
          curiosity in the form of a Commodore64. Unbeknownst to them, this gift would lead Justin down a path 
          far from any chance at obtaining reasonable social skills and towards a Computer Science degree from 
          George Mason University and a healthy obsession with programming. When Justin isn't hacking the Gibson, 
          he spends his time making electronic music or backpacking across the Shenandoah Mountains. His enjoyment 
          of the dichotomy between these two pastimes accurately portraits his neurosis.
