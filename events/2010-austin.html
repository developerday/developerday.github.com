      <h3 class="talk-title">Real Software Engineering</h3>
      <p>
        Software engineering as it's taught in universities simply doesn't work.  It doesn't
        produce software systems of high quality, and it doesn't produce them for low cost.
        Sometimes, even when practiced rigorously (or perhaps especially then) it doesn't
        produce systems at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's odd, because in every other field, the term "engineering" is reserved for
        methods that work.
      </p>
      <p>
        What, then, does real software engineering look like?  Many programmers
        are convinced that it doesn't even make sense to talk about software as
        engineering---they think it's more like a craft or an artistic endeavor.  But 
        what if real software engineering has been right under our noses for a long
        time?
      </p>

      <h3 class="talk-title">Email Interfaces for Your Ruby Apps</h3>
      <p>Email-based user interfaces are an easy and powerful (but often overlooked) way to add a lot of value to web applications. In this presentation, we’ll discuss the advantages of providing an email interface to your app, take a look at some real-world examples (like Posterous, TripIt, and I Want Sandy), and then provide several specific techniques for adding this functionality.</p>

      <h3 class="talk-title">The Art of the Spike</h3>
      <p>
        Exploring new technologies can be both challenging and rewarding.  A good spike can make or break a new feature for your application.  Have you ever thought that a technology or practice your company isn't currently using is the perfect fit for your next iteration?  This is your time to shine!  In this session you will learn how to treat new technologies as first class citizens and prove that it fits your needs.  You will also learn how to provide concrete evidence supporting your decision.  By the end of this session your fear of introducing new technology will simply melt away leaving you with a hunger for new ideas.
