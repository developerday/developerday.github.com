      <h3 class="talk-title">Email Interfaces for Your Ruby Apps</h3>
      <p>Email-based user interfaces are an easy and powerful (but often overlooked) way to add a lot of value to web applications. In this presentation, we’ll discuss the advantages of providing an email interface to your app, take a look at some real-world examples (like Posterous, TripIt, and I Want Sandy), and then provide several specific techniques for adding this functionality.</p>
