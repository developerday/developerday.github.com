      <h3 class="talk-title">Email Interfaces for Your Ruby Apps</h3>
      <p>Email-based user interfaces are an easy and powerful (but often overlooked) way to add a lot of value to web applications. In this presentation, we’ll discuss the advantages of providing an email interface to your app, take a look at some real-world examples (like Posterous, TripIt, and I Want Sandy), and then provide several specific techniques for adding this functionality.</p>

      <h3 class="talk-title">Six Easy Pieces on Functional Programming</h3>
      <p>Languages like Erlang, Clojure, Scala and Haskell are all growing in popularity, each taking a very different approach to functional programming. Despite their differences, they share some important concepts. For the developer new to functional programming, the shock of new language,  concepts and techniques can prove overwhelming. But, broken down to the important and common concepts, the picture becomes clearer. By tackling type systems, pure functions, lazy evaluation, data-oriented programming, concurrency and parallelism as stand-alone ideas, we can better see what functional programming is about and start learning to take advantage of it. After this session, you will know what your first (or next) step down the path to functional programming nirvana will be.</p>

      <h3 class="talk-title">JavaScript/UI Architecture: Be all that you can be</h3>
      <p>Most web applications take UI architecture for granted, simply using out-of-the-box offerings from the framework of choice without much thought. This often yields far too complicated templating, data exchange (Ajax), URL routing, validation, etc. CVC (Client-View-Controller) is an alternative, deconstructed, framework-independent approach to building/delivering performant, maintainable web UI.</p>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Client</strong> <br />Each component is a "client" of every other component -- highly module, portable, and platform/framework agnostic</dd>
          <li><strong>View</strong> <br />Templating engine, written in JavaScript (so it can run either on server or in browser), uses HTML-based templates and accepts simple JSON data</li>
          <li><strong>Controller</strong> <br />URL routing, data validation, etc  The controller modules are also in JavaScript and are the glue between all the pieces, to transfer the data (JSON) and facilitate the "clients" talking to each other</li>
        </ul>

He considers JavaScript the ultimate language and is constantly tinkering with how to push it further. If something can't be done in JavaScript or web technology, he's bored by it. He has a number of open-source projects, including flXHR, LABjs, mpAjax, and jXHR, and he also is a core contributor to SWFObject.

      <h3 class="talk-title">Using Dynamic Web Frameworks in Legacy Environments</h3>
      <p>Have you ever experienced a time when you wanted to use your favorite dynamic web framework but were hamstrung by a legacy technology stack?  What if you needed to create a quick one off or custom application but couldn't figure out how to access your legacy databases using your favorite rapid web development platform?  At Bazaarvoice, the new multi-database branch of Django has become an invaluable tool for us to build rapid prototypes on against our existing, legacy, sharded data platform.  I'll walk through how we use the multi-db branch in this capacity and then further delve into how we used Django along with a custom built SOLR datastore to solve one of our most technically challenging customer problems to date.  While I'll be using Python and Django as the backdrop for this talk, hopefully it will inspire you to push the boundaries of the technology stack you use on a day to day basis in your workplaces.

      <h3 class="talk-title">Superclassy Inheritance with JavaScript</h3>
      <p>Superclassy Inheritance with JavaScript is a quick look at the benefits and consequences of several inheritance patterns in JavaScript. Code reuse plays a major role in the DRY development pattern and leveraging the inheritance patterns built into JavaScript or manipulating them can change the way you build and organize large applications. Unfortunately, JavaScript's reputation and odd naming scheme have stopped people from using all the features that it has to offer. First, we'll discuss the array of options that exist and then go through a real-world example while using our newly honed inheritance-foo to make it play nice.

    <h3 class="talk-title">The Art of the Spike</h3>
    <p>
      Exploring new technologies can be both challenging and rewarding.  A good spike can make or break a new feature for your application.  Have you ever thought that a technology or practice your company isn't currently using is the perfect fit for your next iteration?  This is your time to shine!  In this session you will learn how to treat new technologies as first class citizens and prove that it fits your needs.  You will also learn how to provide concrete evidence supporting your decision.  By the end of this session your fear of introducing new technology will simply melt away leaving you with a hunger for new ideas.

      <h3 class="talk-title">Mary Poppins Meets the Matrix</h3>
      <p>
        Every foreign language you learn makes you a little smarter, and even shapes the way you think. Dave Thomas, one of the founders of the Pragmatic Press, once said that a developer should learn a new programming language every year. In the upcoming book <i>Seven Languages in Seven Weeks</i>, Bruce takes this challenging advice to the extreme. The book, in progress, helps a developer solve a nontrivial problem in each of seven different programming languages, spanning four different programming paradigms. In this keynote, Bruce will take a light hearted look at capturing the character of a programming language in a few short pages.
