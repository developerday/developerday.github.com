      Connect. Learn. Share.
    </h2>

    <p>
      Staying current with the ever-evolving technological possibilities can be challenging, but you love trying. Why? Because you’re a fantastic web developer who loves building things, (and, frankly, that’s just how you roll).
    </p>

    <p>
      Which is why this conference is perfect for you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hear eight presentations given by active practitioners on topics ranging from JavaScript and Scala to Rails performance and security. Each is tailored to give you insight into various topics that may positively influence how you work, regardless of your specialization.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, come meet cool people, eat some lunch (from local Durham restaurants), and give yourself the day to learn and participate in several great discussions — all for the low, low price of $50.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Registration is <strong>closed</strong> for March 21st — but keep your eyes peeled for Developer Days in other cities!

          Jess fled from the ivory tower with a fascination for writing code that automatically generates 
          goodness for video games—from graphics to maps to music. His fascination with rapid prototyping 
          led him to build applications for the web where he contributed to several startups. You can now 
          find him fretting over the front-end of many a web application. Chad has spent the last 10 years 
          roaming the earth building web applications for companies large and small. During his journeys 
          he has contributed regularly to open source in .NET and Ruby. He was last seen championing the 
          causes of Behaviour Driven Development and proper use of the Queen’s English.

            <span class="description">As Phil Karlton said, “there are only two hard things in Computer 
              Science: cache invalidation and naming things.” Despite enormous advances in the field of 
              web development over the last five years, it remains difficult to use caching to allow 
              sites to scale for expanding user bases. Fortunately, the last few years have also seen the 
              rise of JavaScript libraries that take a lot of the pain out of client-side programming. 
              In this talk, we’ll explore techniques for making your sites feel faster, without resorting 
              to complicated caching schemes, while maintaining strict separation of content, style, and 
              behavior.</span>
